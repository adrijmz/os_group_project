Endorsement"In the past few years, deep learning has rapidly evolved into the de-facto approach for acoustic modeling in automatic speech recognition (ASR), showing tremendous improvement in accuracy, robustness, and cross-language generalizability over conventional approaches. This timely book is written by the pioneers of deep learning innovations and applications to ASR, who, as early as 2010, first succeeded in large vocabulary speech recognition using deep learning. This was accomplished using a special form of the deep neural net, developed by the authors, perfectly fit for fast decoding as required by industrial deployment of ASR technology. In addition to recounting this remarkable advance which ignited the industry-scale adoption of deep learning in ASR, this book also provides an overview of a sweeping range of upto-date deep learning methodologies and its application to a variety of signal and information processing tasks, including not only ASR but also computer vision, language modeling, text processing, multimodal learning, and information retrieval. This is the first and the most valuable book for "deep and wide learning" of deep learning, not to be missed by anyone who wants to know the breath taking impact of deep learning in many facets of information processing, especially ASR, all of vital importance to our modern technological society.
