Aim The principle objective of this article is to improve the accuracy of Credit card fraud detection using Novel logistic regression compared with the tSNEMaterials and Methods The categorizing is performed by adopting a sample size of n 10 in novel logistic regression and sample size n 10 in tSNE with a sample size 10 obtained using the Gpower value 80 Results The analysis of the results shows that the Novel logistic regression has a high accuracy of 9989 in comparison with the tSNE6099 There is a statistically significant difference between the study groups with plt 005 Conclusion For Credit card fraud detection it shows that the Logistic Regression appears to generate more accuracy than the tSNE
