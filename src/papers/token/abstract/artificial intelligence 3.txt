Background and objective During the recent global urgency scientists clinicians and healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for a new technology to support in tackling the Covid19 pandemic The evidence of Machine Learning ML and Artificial Intelligence AI application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening predicting forecasting contact tracing and drug development for SARSCoV2 and its related epidemicMethod A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid19 Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters ie abstract methodology and the conclusion was done to relate to the models possibilities for tackling the SARSCoV2 epidemicResult This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in realworld problems The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design medical experts and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid19 pandemic and ahead ConclusionThe ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment medication screening prediction forecasting contact tracing and drugvaccine development process for the Covid19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice However most of the models are not deployed enough to show their realworld operation but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARSCoV2 epidemic
