The emergence of artificial intelligence AI and its progressively wider impact on many sectors requires an assessment of its effect on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals Using a consensusbased expert elicitation process we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals but it may also inhibit 59 targets However current research foci overlook important aspects The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AIbased technologies to enable sustainable development Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency safety and ethical standardsT he emergence of artificial intelligence AI is shaping an increasing range of sectors For instance AI is expected to affect global productivity 1 equality and inclusion 2 environmental outcomes 3 and several other areas both in the short and long term 4 Reported potential impacts of AI indicate both positive 5 and negative 6 impacts on sustainable development However to date there is no published study systematically assessing the extent to which AI might impact all aspects of sustainable developmentdefined in this study as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals SDGs and 169 targets internationally agreed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 7 This is a critical research gap as we find that AI may influence the ability to meet all SDGsHere we present and discuss implications of how AI can either enable or inhibit the delivery of all 17 goals and 169 targets recognized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Relationships were characterized by the methods reported at the end of this study which can be summarized as a consensusbased expert elicitation process informed by previous studies aimed at mapping SDGs interlinkages 8910 A summary of the results is given in Fig 1 and the Supplementary Data 1 provides a complete list of all the SDGs and targets together with the detailed results from this work Although there is no internationally agreed definition of AI for this study we considered as AI any software technology with at least one of the following capabilities perceptionincluding audio visual textual and tactile eg face recognition decisionmaking eg medical diagnosis systems prediction eg weather forecast automatic knowledge
