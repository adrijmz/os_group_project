Artificial intelligence AI based on deep learning DL has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years DL has been widely adopted in image recognition speech recognition and natural language processing but is only beginning to impact on healthcare In ophthalmology DL has been applied to fundus photographs optical coherence tomography and visual fields achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity the glaucomalike disc macular oedema and agerelated macular degeneration DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings Nonetheless there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology including clinical and technical challenges explainability of the algorithm results medicolegal issues and physician and patient acceptance of the AI blackbox algorithms DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future This review provides a summary of the stateoftheart DL systems described for ophthalmic applications potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward InTroduCTIonArtificial intelligence AI is the fourth industrial revolution in mankinds history 1 Deep learning DL is a class of stateoftheart machine learning techniques that has sparked tremendous global interest in the last few years 2 DL uses representationlearning methods with multiple levels of abstraction to process input data without the need for manual feature engineering automatically recognising the intricate structures in highdimensional data through projection onto a lower dimensional manifold 2 Compared with conventional techniques DL has been shown to achieve significantly higher accuracies in many domains including natural language processing computer vision 35 and voice recognition 6 In medicine and healthcare DL has been primarily applied to medical imaging analysis in which DL systems have shown robust diagnostic performance in detecting various medical conditions including tuberculosis from chest Xrays 7 8 malignant melanoma on skin photographs 9 and lymph node metastases secondary to breast cancer from tissue sections 10 DL has similarly been applied to
