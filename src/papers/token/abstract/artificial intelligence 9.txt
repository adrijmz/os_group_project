Autoimmune diseases are chronic multifactorial conditions Through machine learning ML a branch of the wider field of artificial intelligence it is possible to extract patterns within patient data and exploit these patterns to predict patient outcomes for improved clinical management Here we surveyed the use of ML methods to address clinical problems in autoimmune disease A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE embase and computers and applied sciences complete databases Relevant papers included machine learning or artificial intelligence and the autoimmune diseases search terms in their title abstract or key words Exclusion criteria studies not written in English no real human patient data included publication prior to 2001 studies that were not peer reviewed nonautoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers 169 of 702 studies met the criteria for inclusion Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used ML models using data on multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common A small proportion of studies 77 or 13169 combined different data types in the modelling process Crossvalidation combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 83 of papers 14169 The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation crossvalidation and independent testing of ML models Many models achieved good predictive results in simple scenarios eg classification of cases and controls Progression to more complex predictive models may be achievable in future through integration of multiple data types
