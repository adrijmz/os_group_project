<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The rising use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies, including generative AI tools, in organizations is undeniable. As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are:</p><p>(1) human-AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities;</p><p>(3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform-based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research.</p><p>Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>Organizations worldwide are in the midst of a technological shift, often referred to as the fourth industrial revolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Schwab, 2016)</ref>, the second machine age <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brynjolfsson &amp; McAfee, 2014)</ref>, or the algorithmic age <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Danaher et al., 2017)</ref>. This shift is re-shaping the nature of human work, and a major driver of this change is the rapid development and deployment of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies. These technologies are defined as "a collection of interrelated technologies used to solve problems and perform tasks that, when humans do them, requires thinking" <ref type="bibr">(Walsh et al., 2019, p. 14)</ref>. Examples of AI technologies include: machine learning, which identifies patterns in large datasets via varying degrees of human supervision; natural language processing, which extracts, classifies, and translates written or spoken text; visual recognition, which uses image recognition and machine vision; and decision support systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Walsh et al., 2019)</ref>. Generative AI is another subset of artificial intelligence "that, based on a textual prompt, generates novel content," such as written text, music, and visual images <ref type="bibr">(Stanford University, 2023, p. 3)</ref>. While current forms of AI are classified as narrow AI, designed for specific tasks such as image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boden, 2016)</ref>, their growing integration into the workplace, alongside the accelerating development of more sophisticated forms of AI, carries important implications for the nature of work.</p><p>The introduction of AI technologies into organizations has sparked intense debates about its impact on workers and workplaces, with highly polarized views. Some suggest that it will lead to significant job losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Frey &amp; Osborne, 2017)</ref>, while others argue that it will optimize productivity and improve job quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Jarrahi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Spencer, 2018)</ref>. This polarization is compounded by broader societal narratives that offer science fiction-based portrayals of emerging technologies that can mischaracterize current AI systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cave et al., 2018)</ref>. The convergence of these factors can then lead workers to fear the use of AI in their workplaces, regardless of its purpose, and generate negative worker outcomes such as lower commitment to work, cynicism, and turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brougham &amp; Haar, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The current state of the discourse surrounding AI at work calls for an integrative and systematic discussion of its impacts on individual workers, teams, and organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(von Krogh, 2018)</ref>. Neither predominantly pessimistic nor predominantly optimistic views will fully capture the nuanced effects of these technologies, given the differences in how workers perceive them, what they are implemented to do, and the complex socio-technical contexts into which they are deployed. At the same time, there is a lack of integrative discussion on how AI (re)configures work routines, work processes, and skills in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Meijer et al., 2021)</ref> and how workers perceive these changes and respond <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bucher et al., 2021)</ref>. In this article, we provide a systematic review of empirical research that examines the use of AI at work. At individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis, we examine themes regarding human-AI collaboration, human and algorithmic capabilities, human workers' attitudes and experiences related to AI and algorithmic management, and AI's effects on the labor market. By synthesizing existing studies into a coherent multilevel framework, we make three interconnected contributions to the fast-growing literature on AI in management.</p><p>First, we identify how AI is shaping the future of work by changing specific aspects of work processes and human worker experiences. Doing so allows us to unpack research that investigates new divisions of labor across human and AI capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Jarrahi, 2018)</ref> and the optimal interactions between AI systems and human skills to support organizational and worker effectiveness. We also shed light on how human-AI collaboration influences and alters the nature of work and the skills required to thrive in today's organizational landscape.</p><p>Second, our review presents a detailed account of employees' attitudes towards AI use at work and their experiences of algorithmic management, particularly via surveillance and control, in platformbased work. Established technology acceptance models recognize that employee attitudes are important predictors of technology use <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Lee et al., 2009)</ref>. More positive attitudes will likely result in efforts to upskill and functionally use the technology, whereas more negative attitudes will likely result in resistance and poor uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Suseno et al., 2022)</ref>. Employees can also simultaneously hold positive and negative attitudes towards AI depending on their perceptions of the technology and their assessment of its costs and benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lichtenthaler, 2019)</ref>. As such, our research builds knowledge of the varied ways that employees construe AI, which provides an important precursor to understanding how they will use it.</p><p>Third, by expanding the evidence base concerning how AI use generates changes across workplaces and the workforce, our review helps move beyond forecasting of what may occur in AI-enabled workplaces to understanding what is occurring. Recent advances in generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT developed by OpenAI) have prompted academics, technology leaders, and even governments to reconsider the use and implications of AI platforms. For example, several technology leaders and government institutions have petitioned to halt further development of such AI systems until implications for ethics, education, and safety are fully examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Vallance, 2023)</ref>. We contribute to this ongoing discourse by focusing on empirical work that shows how AI technologies operate in their contexts of use. Our review informs organizational implementation strategies and will assist leaders in managing the "human side" of their firms' AI use.</p><p>Overall, our aim is to generate critical insights to strengthen future theorizing and empirical investigation of the outcomes of AI at work, while also discussing how organizational leaders can embed AI systems to promote fairness, diversity, and effective decision making.</p><p>In the following section, we describe our search strategy and coding procedures, which underpin our approach for synthesizing the literature. Next, we discuss the themes that emerged across levels of analysis. Finally, we highlight potential areas for future scholarly work and offer actionable suggestions for practitioners implementing AI in the workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| LITERATURE SEARCH METHOD AND ANALYSIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Search strategy</head><p>We searched for relevant articles using a four-step process, outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> as a PRISMA flowchart. First, we searched the Scopus database using our search terms (see Box 1, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and limited our results to articles published in business/management and psychology 1 subject areas. This initial search yielded 1730 articles. Second, articles were screened for journal quality. To ensure an inclusive sample with a focus on micro-level work, we included articles published in journals ranked 3 or above in business/management (according to the Chartered Association of Business Schools journal list) or of any ranking if published in the psychology subject area (see Box 2, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In the third and fourth steps, we manually screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining articles (n = 363) to ensure that they had a tight focus on the micro-level implications of AI use in relevant management, organizational behavior, and organizational psychology outlets (see Box 3, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, for exclusion criteria). This process resulted in 1 Including this subject area allowed us to capture relevant work in applied and organizational psychology. 97 relevant articles. After excluding review or conceptual-only articles, we included 68 empirical articles to maintain our empirical focus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Coding procedures and approach to organizing the literature</head><p>Following previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Büchter et al., 2020)</ref>, we used a data extraction form to obtain information from the articles, including their objectives, theories used, research design, method features, and findings. To ensure consistency in our data extraction and to assist with this process, we trained four research assistants who hold advanced degrees in business management. Using an inductive approach, we then identified themes and categories and drew inferences about the underlying topics of the articles in our review <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Woo et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Instead of approaching the articles with a predetermined categorization scheme, our inductive approach allowed the themes to emerge organically through immersion in the corpus of work (for similar approaches, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Conz &amp; Magnani, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lightfoot et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The data extraction form provided an initial basis for clustering papers according to their focus. Each paper was then read in full, with the themes developing through a process of iteration and refinement.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F I G U R E 1 Flow diagram of search process.</formula><p>For instance, the "Human-AI Collaboration" theme (now Theme 1) initially included work from "Perceptions of Human and Algorithmic Capabilities" and "Worker Attitudes Towards AI" themes (now Themes 2 and 3, respectively). But further immersion in the articles led us to identify nuanced distinctions across the work. Some articles explicitly compared human and algorithmic labor (which emerged as Theme 2), while others focused on worker attitudes towards AI (which emerged as Theme 3). The remaining themes then developed more clearly as distinct work, such as a clear set of articles focused on algorithmic management in platform work (Theme 4). Overall, our sample is comprised of five themes. Each theme and example constitutive articles are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>In the following sections, we delve into our analysis of the five themes that emerged from our review of the literature. These themes, while interconnected, are distinct and have implications across multiple levels of analysis: individual (e.g., individual-level attitudes, T A B L E 1 Key themes from empirical research on AI in the workplace. characteristics, and experiences); group (e.g., group and team processes); and organizational (e.g., systems, culture, and leadership practices). We begin with the largest theme of human-AI collaboration (n = 20 articles), followed by two themes that focus on employeelevel perceptions of and attitudes towards AI. We then discuss the themes that center around AI's effects on a broader set of workers and the labor market. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> provides an integrative framework that synthesizes the key findings across our five themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">| RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Theme 1: Human-AI collaboration</head><p>The productivity and efficiency benefits of AI can only be realized through intentional and functional collaboration between humans and the technology. The future of work is frequently discussed in terms of the importance of such human-AI collaboration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Jarrahi, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Essentially, this involves the application of AI systems to complement or to augment human work, skills, or training, rather than simply replacing workers with AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brynjolfsson, 2023)</ref>. As AI has diverse applications, the specific ways in which it can support human workers are varied and can include providing performance feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Tong et al., 2021)</ref>; using digital assistants <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Malik et al., 2022)</ref>; improving decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Meijer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Trocin et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">van den Broek et al., 2021)</ref>; and enhancing customer interactions and service offerings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kim et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Pemer, 2021)</ref>. Our review identifies several factors and processes that either enable or hinder the realization of these intended technological benefits at the individual, group, and organizational levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">| Individual level</head><p>The nature of human-AI collaboration at the individual level is shaped by various factors, including AI attributes, the effects of AI on tasks and job designs 2 and how these are experienced by employees, and workers' attitudes towards AI. Higher satisfaction with the technology's features, such as its performance on the task and fit to users' needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2022a)</ref>, led to favorable outcomes such as increased job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2022a)</ref> and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Marikyan et al., 2022)</ref>. Workers who perceive a good task-technology fit, such as by viewing AI as undertaking repetitive tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Sowa et al., 2021)</ref>, being specialized to a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Sowa &amp; Przegalinska, 2020)</ref>, improving their decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kawaguchi, 2021)</ref>, and who perceive good AI system quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2022b)</ref>, were more likely to value the technology, use it as intended, and improve their performance. Our review also indicates that better human-AI collaboration occurs when workers trust the AI, understand its nature and purpose, and develop the skills to use it <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Chowdhury et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The way that AI altered workers' job designs, and the associated demands and resources they experienced, also exerted effects on the</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F I G U R E 2</formula><p>Integrative framework of key findings.</p><p>2</p><p>We do note that job and task design are often, at least initially, determined at an organizational level. We position these factors at the individual level as the focus of these articles reflects how people experience their work as a result of interacting with AI, rather than a focus on how those AI implementation choices were made.</p><p>nature of human-AI collaboration. For example, enhanced innovative behaviors were observed when AI was applied to support job autonomy, job complexity, specialization, and information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Verma &amp; Singh, 2022)</ref>. In a service work context, AI can enhance workers' resources by reducing mental and physical fatigue and increasing positive emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Qiu et al., 2022)</ref>. Such outcomes are also facilitated by AI developers effectively combining machine intelligence and human domain expertise, in conjunction with those human experts, to create a human-machine learning hybrid work practice (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Broek et al., 2021)</ref>. However, the use of AI can also generate demands that impede its potential benefits. For example, AI use can increase requirements for worker skill development <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Verma &amp; Singh, 2022)</ref> and induce technology overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kim et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Individuals' algorithmic aversion, defined as resistance to the use of algorithmic advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dietvorst et al., 2015)</ref>, can also negatively affect AI use, with workers' domain experience or level of expertise influencing the extent of this aversion. Workers with higher domain expertise usually have higher algorithmic aversion, due to perceiving greater accountability for AI-generated outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen &amp; Choudhury, 2022)</ref> and believing they have superior capabilities to AI and therefore seeing little benefit in its use <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kim et al., 2022)</ref>. The effects of this aversion, however, can be marginally attenuated by allowing workers to incorporate their knowledge alongside AI output <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kawaguchi, 2021)</ref> or having greater human decision input overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Haesevoets et al., 2021)</ref>. Workers with low domain expertise are also more likely to be algorithmically averse, but due to lesser ability to assess and effectively use AI's output <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen &amp; Choudhury, 2022)</ref>. By contrast, workers with moderate domain experience are usually more likely to use AI and generate benefits from its use <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen &amp; Choudhury, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Relatedly, individuals' performance levels also influence their ability to collaborate with AI systems effectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Luo et al. (2021)</ref> found that lower and higher ranked performers experienced fewer benefits from AI feedback due to information overload and algorithmic aversion, respectively. Conversely, middle-ranked performers achieved the best outcomes from AI advice. These findings suggest that restricting feedback helps lower ranked performers assimilate the AI-generated advice.</p><p>Interestingly, a mix of AI and human coach advice improved outcomes for both lower and higher ranked performers. In contrast to these findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bader and Kaiser (2019)</ref> found that lower ranked performers gained a cognitive advantage from AI through provision of specific and helpful information to support customer interactions. Emerging evidence regarding generative AI's effects on workers supports this, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brynjolfsson et al. (2023)</ref> showing that the introduction of a generative AI conversational assistant led to lower skilled and novice customer support workers gaining a productivity advantage, but with little gain achieved by higher skilled and more experienced workers. However, employees' attitudes towards AI also play a role. Related findings indicate that disclosure of AI assistance to workers can generate distrust and fear of displacement from the technology, which stifles potential collaboration and dampens productivity benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Tong et al., 2021)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Theme 2: Perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities</head><p>People make different assessments of humans and algorithms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Tomprou &amp; Lee, 2022)</ref>, including of their relative strengths and weaknesses in undertaking different tasks. The changing division of work between AI and humans represents a key change in work processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Wilson &amp; Daugherty, 2018)</ref>. This means that uncovering the upsides and downsides of human capabilities in relation to algorithmic capabilities is critical for understanding under what conditions workers are more or less likely to accept the use of AI for certain tasks and are more or less likely to rely on AI for advice. This theme concentrates on how people perceive human and algorithmic labor, especially in the contexts of evaluating information and making decisions. Such work is important for informing the design and deployment of AI systems, by highlighting which types of tasks people prefer human labor to do and which tasks they prefer algorithms to undertake. This theme also expands our understanding of potential drivers of algorithmic aversion and algorithmic appreciation, the latter referring to people being receptive to and relying on algorithmic advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Logg et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Unlike the broader work in Theme 1, this research more explicitly compares individuals' (e.g., workers' and end users') perceptions of humans and algorithms performing the same job functions. As these studies all focus on perceptions at the individual level of analysis, we highlight three sub-themes that capture the antecedents and outcomes of how people view algorithmic and human capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">| Perceived capabilities: Differentiating strengths and limitations of human workers and AI systems</head><p>Favorable algorithmic capabilities include its perceived objectivity in decision making compared to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Pethig &amp; Kroenung, 2022)</ref>, its ability to follow structured decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Keding &amp; Meissner, 2021)</ref>, its lack of intentionality and self-interest (Candrian &amp; Scherer, 2022), and its ability to enhance cognitive absorption in a service interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Balakrishnan &amp; Dwivedi, 2021)</ref>. For example, in the context of investment decision making, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Keding and Meissner (2021)</ref> found that within such objective task environments, human managers are more likely to perceive algorithmic recommendations as more legitimate compared to identical human recommendations. Human managers are more likely to trust algorithmic recommendations, as they believe that algorithms follow a more structured decision-making process that improves the quality of those decisions. However, algorithmic capabilities also have drawbacks, such as their perceived reductionist and decontextualized approach to decision making, potentially resulting in inequitable decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Newman et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gonzalez et al. (2022)</ref> found that job applicants have reduced confidence and a decreased sense of control when autonomous AI systems make recruitment decisions without any human involvement, due to the perception of less opportunity to convey their skills and abilities.</p><p>On the other hand, human labor, when compared to machine labor, is perceived to generate unique products <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Granulo et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Humans can also take into account the personal and underlying conditions that affect employees' performance more holistically than algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Newman et al., 2020)</ref>.

For example, studies could compare the likelihood of employees working alongside an AI that they perceive as encroaching on their human capabilities versus collaborating with an AI that is within its perceived capability boundaries. These perceptions may operate through mechanisms such as the perceived value or uniqueness of human skills for certain tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Granulo et al., 2021)</ref>. As AI continues to advance, including in its generative forms, workers' views of human and AI capabilities may also change.

This could amplify both positive and negative attitudes towards AI (Theme 3), generating barriers to effective human-AI collaboration (Theme 1). Depending upon its context of deployment, the use of generative AI may also heighten workers' awareness of the ongoing value of human skills within a work process (possibly via perceptions of human skill value), thereby enhancing human-AI collaboration. While employees' AI skills and familiarity also support AI use (Theme 1), the increasingly intuitive and user-friendly interfaces of generative AIs may ultimately lessen such skill demands (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Manning, 2023</ref> for such an example).</p><p>We believe that these questions necessitate conceptual and empirical efforts to address how such technology can replace or streamline existing tasks performed by humans and how humans can perform higher-order cognitive tasks with the assistance of, or in collaboration with, AI. To expand on the Theme 5 insights regarding workers' AI-relevant skillsets, research could investigate the role of cognitive flexibility, which enables individuals to switch between tasks or stimulus sets quickly and efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Feng et al., 2020)</ref>. This flexibility may allow workers to effectively integrate and situate AI output with other information sources across different tasks and so may be an important mechanism for explaining why workers with different performance levels extract different value from AI use (as seen in Theme 1; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Luo et al., 2021)</ref>. Organizational behavior researchers could also integrate evidence from information systems and humancomputer interaction literature to expand on work in Theme 1, which highlights the importance of AI system quality for worker behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2022b)</ref>. Future studies could explore how different interfaces, types, and quality of AI systems encourage employee-AI collaboration. For example, the enhanced intuitiveness of some generative AI interfaces could improve perceived ease of use and task engagement to support human-AI collaboration, whereas poorly designed and difficult-to-use systems of variable quality may limit these mechanisms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">| Organizational level</head><p>The growing use of AI has led to concerns about whether it will lead to a hyper-rational organizational culture that prioritizes AI output over human contributions, as it is seen as efficient, objective, and undertaking structured, unbiased analyses (per Theme 2, and see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kahneman, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, it is important to examine how this culture affects leaders' attitudes and behaviors towards AI, such as their tendency for automation bias (i.e., overreliance on machine output), the degree to which they delegate to AI, and the potential consequences of such actions.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Robert et al. (2020)</ref> argue that organizational scholars must investigate how AI can be deployed to promote fairness in managerial practices, such as hiring, promotion, and compensation decisions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bankins et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Lee, 2018)</ref>. Accordingly, we recommend that future research examines the role of AI through the lens of organizational justice to determine how AI-based tools can either support or threaten fairness and transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Colquitt, 2001)</ref>. One possible approach is to explore how AI can be used to enhance employees' perceptions and experiences of fair pay and rewards (distributive justice), transparency in dispute resolution processes (procedural justice), and respectful treatment (interactional justice). Given individuals' perceptions of human and AI capabilities (Theme 2), these effects may depend on the specific tasks for which AI is employed. Additionally, it would be valuable to examine the role of AI in supporting restorative justice, which entails actions to remedy harms, rebuild relationships, and rectify injustices <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Wiseman &amp; Stillwell, 2022)</ref>. For instance, researchers could explore novel ways that AI can assist employees in restoring their trust in and commitment to their leaders and organizations following incidents of mistreatment or significant disruption.</p><p>Since such experiences can elicit intense emotions, the perceived objectivity of AI (as discussed in Theme 2) may aid in mediating conflict resolution efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">| Group level</head><p>Across our themes, we found that AI can have a significant impact on digital divides, where technologies can reinforce existing socioeconomic disparities between advanced and developing economies, metropolitan and rural areas, and more or less privileged individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Kitsara, 2022)</ref>. For example, our review shows that AI is already benefiting highly skilled and highly educated workers, leading to better paying and better quality jobs with enhanced skill sets. Conversely, lower skilled and lower educated workers are more likely to become unemployed due to the integration of AI into the workplace, thereby exacerbating pre-existing inequalities (Fossen &amp; Sorgner, 2022). These findings drive a pressing set of research inquiries: How does the implementation of AI either intensify or alleviate digital divides?</p><p>Under what circumstances does AI exacerbate inequalities, and when does it mitigate them? Equally important is the examination of how vulnerable groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Restubog et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Restubog et al., , 2023) )</ref> perceive and experience the fairness-or lack thereof-of AI utilization.</p><p>Our review also shows how members of certain groups (e.g., women) may perceive algorithmic decision making as fairer than human decision making due to historical biases perpetrated by dominant social groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Pethig &amp; Kroenung, 2022)</ref>. These findings align with emerging research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Lee &amp; Rich, 2021</ref>) that explores how marginalized groups view AI based on ingroup and outgroup perceptions and beliefs about its potential to rectify systemic biases. We recommend conducting additional group-level analyses to determine how minority groups in the workplace are benefitting from the implementation of AI or whether they feel particularly vulnerable to its negative impacts.</p></div>

Conceptually, scholars must take a theory-driven approach to capture the antecedents, boundary conditions, mechanisms, and outcomes of AI implementation at various levels of analysis. This is consistent with the suggestions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Chen et al. (2005)</ref> that applying a multilevel theory perspective requires an explicit assessment of homology, whereby similar relationships exist between parallel constructs across various levels of analysis. If the consequences of AI are homogenous across levels of analysis, it contributes to the breadth of AI use (e.g., where AI elicits benefits at the individual, group, and organizational levels). However, if the consequences of AI are not homogenous across levels, which several themes in our review suggest (e.g., AI elicits both advantageous and maladaptive consequences across levels), then there is a need to theorize how and when moderators and mediators operate at each level of analysis. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bankins and Formosa (2023)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1">| Multilevel theorizing</head><p>To connect analyses across levels, it is necessary to utilize theories that explicitly account for multilevel phenomena. Our review's main findings suggest that individual resources, such as tenure, skills, and reputational power (Themes 1, 3, and 4), and organizational resources, such as a supportive culture (Themes 1 and 3), can enhance outcomes from employees' interactions with AI. To facilitate multilevel theorizing of AI's workplace effects, we recommend utilizing conservation of resources (COR) theory. This theory posits that people strive to protect and gain resources, while minimizing resource threat and loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Hobfoll et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chen et al. (2015)</ref> integrate the crossover model with COR theory to examine how resource exchange occurs across levels, such as from organizational to group to individual levels, providing the conceptual tools to theorize and then to empirically test multilevel relationships. Crossover refers to the ways that positive or negative states (including resources) transmit from, for example, a person to a wider group or vice versa, via mechanisms such as empathy (direct crossover), specific forms of interaction (indirect crossover), or experiences of shared stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Westman, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of AI at work, researchers can leverage the multilevel factors identified in our review to investigate whether negative individual-level experiences of AI (e.g., via excessive job demands) transmit to the team, via empathy or shared stressor experiences, and whether this process is exacerbated by aspects of the organizational context (e.g., an authoritarian culture). Such conditions would likely create depleted resource passageways, reflecting an environment that threatens and undermines resource repertoires at multiple levels of analysis. Conversely, enriched resource passageways would likely create different outcomes. For example, organizational resource investment in fostering learning or a safety culture could offer supportive resources that generate positive individual-level emotional states.</p><p>Through enhanced thought-action repertoires generated by these positive emotions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fredrickson, 2001)</ref>, employees may experiment with novel ways to use the technology, which can positively shape group-level attitudes through their technology frames or use of liminal spaces.</p><p>By utilizing a COR perspective, researchers can uncover the multilevel conditions that promote (or diminish) resource gains from AI use and lead to enriched (or impoverished) resource passageways, which in turn improve (or reduce) the likelihood of successful deployment and use of AI at work.

As such, managers must carefully identify not only the types of tasks but also the types of groups that are most likely to benefit from human-AI collaboration. In other words, it is crucial for managers to determine which tasks are best suited to AI and which employees would benefit most from working with AI systems. This is essential to foster relational coordination and trust between employees and AI, while ensuring that job functions remain streamlined. In addition to task types, managers should consider group characteristics such as size, dynamics, and identity, which may influence the level of AI adoption and collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Parry et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">| Organizational level</head><p>Our review underscores that successful AI implementation involves bundling work practices and support mechanisms together, rather than treating technology as a standalone solution.

To encourage employees to use AI productively, organizations must also empower them by providing opportunities to build confidence and task mastery with AI systems. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chhillar and Aguilera (2022)</ref> assert that the application of appropriate forms of governance modalities (e.g., norms and laws) can harness AI decision making across individuals and businesses. Encouraging interactions between employees and AI that promote productivity and task enjoyment can also be effective, such as Amazon's practice of allowing warehouse employees to paint their collaborative robots to give them personalities, thereby highlighting task and social interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Gonzalez, 2017)</ref>. To promote AI acceptance, employees also need to feel that their value and social status are higher than AI systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kolbjørnsrud et al., 2017)</ref>, making it important to consider the impact of AI on employees' sense of job security and status. By implementing AI systems in ways that complement and expand, rather than replace, workers' knowledge and skills, organizations can help to reduce anxiety and build employees' trust in the technology. Overall, successful AI integration involves a comprehensive approach that considers technological and human factors. By creating supportive work environments and empowering employees, organizations can unlock the full potential of AI systems while minimizing negative consequences.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>3. 3 |</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Theme 3: Worker attitudes towards AI Although proponents of AI systems argue for their ability to enhance efficiency and worker effectiveness, discussions around the future of work also focus on negative, fear-based, and threat-focused employee attitudes towards AI. This theme highlights the drivers and outcomes of these fear-based worker attitudes, which can impede employee adoption of AI technologies (Tong et al., 2021). These attitudes center around proxies for employees' awareness that: (a) AI and smart forms of technology may replace them or their current job in the future and/or affect their career prospects (e.g., via AI awareness and anxiety; Lingmont &amp; Alexiou, 2020, Suseno et al., 2022); (b) their skills may become obsolete as a result of these technologies (e.g., via perceived automation risk; Innocenti &amp; Golin, 2022); and (c) these technologies will radically change their current work (e.g., via the threat of technological disruption; Brougham &amp; Haar, 2020). The effects of these fear-based attitudes are transmitted through reduced organizational commitment, diminished work and job engagement, and increased perceptions of job insecurity. Such attitudes are then associated with heightened turnover intentions, job burnout, and resistance to change and external technologies (Arias-Pérez &amp; Vélez-<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Jaramillo, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Suseno et al., 2022)</ref>. However, individual-and organizational-level factors can influence these effects and potentially result in increased commitment, satisfaction, and performance.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>technologies play a critical role in the control mechanisms utilized by platforms, shaping the organization of work in various ways. First, AI provides new forms of technological infrastructure that connects with workers, allocates work, and oversees and controls minute aspects of the work process, whether in the form of background smart machinery and analytics or as specific apps used by the worker<ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Huang, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Veen et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, in a food delivery context,<ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Huang (2022)</ref> illustrates how order dispatch systems collate and analyze drivers' characteristics (e.g., location and performance) and broader task characteristics (e.g., weather and traffic conditions) to optimally allocate work.Second, customer ratings or other forms of rating-and-ranking systems exert significant control over workers and can influence the nature, type, and amount of work they are allocated. The use of AI systems that collect and analyze vast amounts of data suggest that workers operate in an environment where they are managed and rated by multiple stakeholders without direct supervision, leading to reduced individual power over the work they receive<ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Wood et al., 2019)</ref>.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>riences is heavily influenced by what the technology is designed and implemented to do. If AI is designed and deployed to replace or give orders to workers, it reduces labor demand, wage growth, skill use, and job quality. Conversely, when AI is implemented to create new human tasks or support workers by providing decision-making information, it promotes employment, wage growth, skill use, and improved work practices. In the face of AI's displacement effects, men and more highly skilled and educated workers are likely to adjust better. Additionally, workers will likely need a range of higher level cognitive skills given AI deployment. A firm's exposure to AI technologies also affects its demand for workers.4 | FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGESOur integrative review highlights the significant implications of AI for the future of work at individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis. Based on the themes extracted from across our review and cross-pollinating their ideas, we offer five research pathways that advance the scope of organizational behavior research on AI. A key theme that emerged across our review is the importance of creating supportive, threat-reducing, and resilience-and confidence-building conditions and uses of AI to enhance positive experiences and adoption by workers. This overarching theme informs our recommendations across each pathway. Table2summarizes our future research agenda by outlining illustrative factors and mechanisms and offering specific research questions.4.1 | Pathway 1: Using AI to facilitate worker wellbeing and satisfactionOur review emphasizes the importance of employee perceptions and attitudes towards AI and how these influence their responses to its use. This points to future research opportunities that examine how the integration of AI systems can support employee health and wellbeing. This would enable the identification of precursors to positive employee attitudes towards AI, rather than focusing on negative ones (Theme 3). Research on AI in cognate disciplines such as psychology, counseling, and computer science has already initiated concerted efforts to investigate how AI systems can promote health and wellbeing, including the expansion of digital counseling delivery, particularly in resource-constrained environments<ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Pataranutaporn et al., 2021)</ref>. To build on this work, we propose integrating ideas from the positive technology domain, an area within the human-computer interaction field. This domain focuses on how technology development and deployment can enhance human well-being and flourishing by generating positive experiences from technology use, such as by supporting self-actualization, positive affect, and enhancing human connection (</figDesc></figure>

Future research could explore specific group-level attitudes or behaviors in teams that facilitate the assimilation of new technologies and support positive well-being. This is crucial because previous research shows that group-level sensemaking is important in shaping how technology affects workers. Under the umbrella of the social validation context, which refers to ways in which the social context supports sensemaking of change (Selenko</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>4. 3 |</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Pathway 3: Examining AI-supported leadership Our review suggests a need to broaden our understanding of leaders' roles in deploying AI systems, particularly in relation to decisionmaking, job-designing, and feedback-giving practices. Parry et al.(2016) urge organizational scholars to reflect on the potential benefits and consequences of AI replacing critical aspects of tasks performed by leaders. As organizations increasingly adopt AI, the challenge is for scholars to help leaders not only reskill employees for AI use but also explore how the technology can enhance their leadership functions.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Future</head><label></label><figDesc>research can deepen our understanding of how AI-supported decision systems can assist human leaders in carrying out various functions such as setting goals, facilitating creativity, identifying and correcting decision errors, and increasing team-machine and humanmachine collaboration. Job design perspectives can be particularly useful in unpacking these interactions. While delegation to AI can improve managerial perceptions of decision quality (Keding &amp; Meissner, 2021), emerging research suggests that employees may have different views and responses to humans or AIs undertaking leadership functions (de Cremer, 2020). For instance, Lanz et al. (2023) note that employees are less likely to comply with unethical instructions from an AI than a human supervisor. Future work could examine how those individual-level beliefs, of leaders, employees, and stakeholders, shape the use and acceptance of AI for certain leadership activities and ultimately impact leader-employee influence processes. Additionally, future research can assess how AI-based leadership decision systems can support human leaders in carrying out complex functions in real-time. More specifically, scholars can explore how the interactivity and adaptability of AI decision systems assist managers in providing immediate feedback and how AI systems can support leaders in correcting errors in their judgment, especially during critical incidents.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>algorithmic management is clearly shaping the experiences of platform workers, it remains to be seen how effective, and indeed possible, these forms of control are in broader work environments. For example, in the context of home credit agents' work, Terry et al. (2022) note that work activities related to tacit judgment and emotional labor are difficult to quantify and can fall outside the gaze of algorithmic management. Future research could explore how leaders use algorithmic management, people analytics, and control mechanisms in their work teams across industries and job tasks to gain a better understanding of the efficacy and outcomes of these approaches.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head>4. 4 |</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Pathway 4: Using AI to promote fairness in organizational processes and outcomes A crucial area for future research is the potential of AI for promoting diversity and fairness within organizations. Although AI can enhance task efficiency, researchers can expand on its outcomes by exploring how AI can mitigate long-standing issues concerning fairness, equity, and transparency. The literature on ethical and responsible AI is growing, but organizational behavior researchers are yet to fully leverage their abundance of organizational justice and fairness constructs to advance a theoretically driven and systematic design agenda for fair and responsible AI at work.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>fair and just development, use, and management of AI technologies"(Bankins &amp; Formosa, 2021, p. 60)-our review demonstrates that people can identify fairness dimensions to organizational use of AI. To further expand Theme 1, we suggest that future work can investigate how an organization's perceived ethical climate or perceived (un)ethical approaches to AI use can affect employees' willingness to collaborate with these technologies. Fairness heuristic theory suggests that people make assessments of their fair treatment by a given institution, which then shapes their interactions with it<ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Lind, 2001)</ref> and potentially reduces their apprehension. With the increasing prevalence of AI, such fairness perceptions are likely to be influenced by organizations' approaches to ethically sensitive uses of the technology, such as for employee surveillance and performance management, as well as whether organizations explicitly adopt ethical AI principles and participatory approaches to AI design (van den Broek et al., 2021). Given increasing community awareness that when AI systems fail they potentially fail at scale, perceptions of an organization's ethical AI use are likely to become more widespread and could significantly affect how employees utilize the technology (see also da Motta Veiga et al., 2023).4.5 | Pathway 5: Incorporating multilevel thinking in AI research Our review and future research recommendations lay the foundation for a multilevel conceptualization of AI in the workplace. Although AI implementation inherently involves multilevel processes, these have not yet been fully explored in the organizational behavior literature. While individual level data points have been used to make assumptions about the implications of AI in management research, future work must examine whether, how, and to what extent organizational-or group-level factors drive individual-level attitudes about AI use and its conse-</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>tilevel theorizing and identifying ways to link analyses across levels can help provide a comprehensive understanding of AI's implications at work.4.5.2 | Multilevel methodsMethodologically, there are various approaches available to conduct the multilevel research proposed above. Our review reveals that organizational scholarship in AI is primarily based on single-sourced and cross-sectional designs, which provide limited insight into the robustness of AI implementation and consequences at different levels of analysis. While single-level studies remain valuable, we believe that cross-level longitudinal field investigations, which examine AI adoption or aversion, would broaden the breadth of understanding of AI's effects at work. To achieve this, we suggest following the recommendations of<ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hoffman et al. (2019)</ref> and<ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Mathieu and Chen (2011)</ref> by carefully considering the: (a) level of theory (i.e., the focal entities to which generalizations are intended to apply); (b) level of measurement (i.e., the entities where data are collected); and (c) level of analysis (i.e., the level at which data are analyzed). It is critical to make these distinctions explicit, as<ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Short et al. (2008)</ref> argue that clustering employees based solely on conceptual and analytic convenience, such as groups, organizations, or supervisors they report to, can compromise the reliability of multilevel findings. Further, we suggest that scholars account for multilevel temporal issues associated with multilevel relationships in AI deployment. Workers' perceptions and attitudes towards AI and subsequent individual-, group-, or organizational-level outcomes are not static phenomena and will likely change over time.5 | IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICEOur review has important practical implications, by showing how AI can generate a range of opportunities and challenges across multiple levels of analysis. The successful implementation of AI in the workplace depends on a range of factors that influence how workers and organizations respond to new technological developments. To support effective deployment of AI systems and mitigate potential harms, we offer several recommendations for employees and managers.Our findings show that employees can hold both positive and negative perceptions AI systems, depending on the benefits and risks associated with their implementation. To foster enthusiasm and interest in AI systems among employees, managers can use positively framed messages when introducing AI-related topics.<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Chuan et al. (2019)</ref> suggest that when presented in this way, AI's benefits (e.g., for improving work quality and well-being) are viewed with greater specificity. In addition, to navigate fast-paced technological changes, managers must address employees' potentially negative anticipations of AI use by providing resources such as on-site technology assistants and instructional materials, and offering formal training to socialize employees before and during implementation of AI systems<ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Makarius et al., 2020)</ref>.</figDesc></figure>

Our comprehensive review of empirical research into AI workplace use provides valuable insights into the critical factors that influence successful human-AI collaboration, perceptions of human and algorithmic capabilities, employees' attitudes towards AI and algorithmic management, and the impact of AI use on labor markets and skills. This research lays a crucial foundation for scholars and leaders to effectively navigate the complex landscape of AI adoption and create a balance between productivity and well-being benefits for workers. It is imperative that organizations adopt effective implementation strategies that prioritize the needs of workers and promote a collaborative work environment. Only then can we fully harness the potential of AI to enhance work processes and ultimately improve the lives of workers now and in the future.</figDesc></figure>

Articles within this theme are predominantly qualitative studies that focus on how new forms of AI technology are transforming labor processes. A major area of interest is algorithmic management and the ways that AI technologies exert control over workers and their responses to this 'management by algorithm'. While precarious employment is not new, AI technologies are playing an increasingly pervasive and significant role in managing gig workers' employment. These technologies can function as intermediaries that match workers to clients, capture data to rate and rank workers, allocate work, and even dismiss workers from platforms. They can also compute metrics that aid in monitoring and surveilling workers at various stages of the work process.
