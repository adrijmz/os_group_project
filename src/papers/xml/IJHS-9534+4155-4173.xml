<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>Data mining is the discovery of information or models for pre-existing data. The corresponding models made up of one of several things. In data analytics research, the statisticians were the first to use the term "Data Mining". The term data mining was a critical term mentioning to challenges to retrieve hidden information that was not stayed by the data. The statistical based researchers view data mining concepts as the creation of a statistical model, that is, a fundamental probability distribution from which the visible data is drawn <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The credit card customers and industry has considered computing statistical models for automation. Recently, these types of statistical models have been used to various areas likes academic research, especially with respect to share markets and e-commerce. The credit card fraud-detection domain is s growing field in Covid periods and presents many challenging and issues for using data mining techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The global e-commerce will predict to reach almost 7k billion US dollars in 2023 as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. E-commerce frauds mainly focused on credit cards as a means of payment through credit card adoption. The credit card fraud ratio is the same or perhaps slightly growing indicted worldwide as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The annual value of consumers losses on card-not-present (CNP) fraud for debit and credit cards issued in the United Kingdom (UK) alone for 2019 amounted to 470.2 million GBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Over the years, technology has significantly changed, and so have the fraud patterns. Today, CNP is a dominant type of fraud, as visible in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, and it is reported that <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>: CNP fraud accounted for 1.43 billion in fraud losses in 2018 that means increase of 17.7% compared with 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Related Works</head><p>Credit card fraud detection is one of the most essential research area discovered domains of fraud detection and its depend on the computerization recorded transactions to detect fraudulent behavior. Every time a credit card is used, transaction data, composed of several attributes (e.g., credit card identifier, transaction date, recipient, amount of the transaction), are stored in the databases of the service provider. However, a single transaction information is typically not sufficient to detect a fraud occurrence and the analysis must consider aggregate measures like total spent per day, transaction number per week or average amount of a transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Data mining technique used in solving unsolvable problems in the field of credit fraud detection problem. Credit card fraud detection mainly used to identify those transactions that are fraudulent into two main classes of valid (genuine) and fraudulent transactions. Credit card fraud finding is constructed on analysis of a card's spending behavior. Many techniques have been applied to credit card fraud detection, artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, support vector machine, frequent itemset mining, decision tree, migrating bird's optimization algorithm and na√Øve bayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Now a days most of the research compare their proposed related review of literature and its algorithms with a benchmark algorithm. The comparison using different standard binary for classification measurement called as misclassification error, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), F1Score <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> or AUC statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The above measures may not be the most appropriate evaluation methods for evaluating the credit card fraud detection models and assume that different misclassification errors carry the same cost and similarly with the correct classified transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Now a days most of the researchers are using statistical modeling tools used to solve the task, observe the true singularities in the real world only through a proxy given as a restricted set of point-wise observations. In credit-card fraud detection, the true phenomenon of interest is the genuine purchase behavior of card holders or, likewise, the malicious behavior of fraudsters <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In our experiment, we use random forest as a classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The popularity of decision tree models in data mining is owed to their simplification in algorithm and flexibility in handling different data attribute types <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, single-tree model is possibly sensitive to specific training data and easy to overfit <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Seven classification algorithms such as J48, Random Tree (RT), Decision Stump (DS), Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Hoeffding Tree (HT), Reduce Error Pruning (REP) and Random Forest (RF) are used to measure the accuracy. Data mining and machine learning techniques build with WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) tools which is used to finding experimental results of weather related dataset. Out of seven classification algorithms, Random tree algorithm outperforms other algorithms by yielding an accuracy of 85.714% <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the authors discuss another paper clearly data mining with decision tree approaches using medical related data <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The real-world research mainly focuses on unsupervised learning techniques can help the fraud detection systems to find various anomalies relating to the credit card issues. In this research paper authors present a hybrid supervised and unsupervised techniques to improve the fraud detection accuracy. Unsupervised outlier scores, figured at different levels of granularity, are compared and tested on a real, annotated, credit card fraud detection dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Credit Card Fraud Detection</head><p>The pandemic situations, the credit card companies can diagnose fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not exciting for items that they did not obtaining. The following Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> indicate credit card fraud detection increase year by year and explain evaluation of the total value of credit card fraud within single euro payments area. Finally, it is also vital for businesses not to detect transactions which are honest as fraudulent, if not, the companies would keep blocking the credit card, and which may lead to client disappointment. So at this time are two important expects of this analysis:</p><p>‚Ä¢ What would happen when the company will not be able to detect the fraudulent transaction and would not confirm from a customer about this recent transaction whether it was made by him/her. ‚Ä¢ In contract, what would happen when the company will detect a genuine transaction as fraudulent and keep calling customer for confirmation or might block the card.</p><p>The datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> contain transactions that have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. So, the dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. When we try to build the prediction model with this kind of unbalanced dataset, then the model will be more inclined towards to detect new unseen transaction as genuine as our dataset contains about 99% genuine data. As our credit card dataset is highly imbalanced, use accuracy score as a metric because it will be usually high and misleading, we should focus on f1-score, precision/recall score or confusion matrix.</p><p>Due to confidentiality issue, original features v1, v2, ... v28 have been transformed with PCA, however, we may guess that these features might be originally credit card number, expiry date, CVV, cardholder name, transaction location, transaction date-time, etc. Two features have not been changed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. In this research feature 'Time' contains the seconds forgotten between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount for the corresponding card customer, this feature can be used for cost-sensitive learning and the feature 'Class' denoted as response variable, and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)</head><p>In statistical analysis, linear regression is a basic and most of the researchers are commonly used prediction problems. The overall interpretation of regression analysis is to clearly be explained two types of things, set of predictor variables do amazing jobs for predicting the futures based on dependent variables and variables are important predictors of the outcome variable. This regression which is used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.</p><p>Multiple linear regression model known as multiple regression. It is used to finding the prediction and a statistical technique which is include several explanatory variables is to be used to predict the outcome of the response or predicted variable. The advantages of MLE model are to model the linearity between the explanatory or independent variable and response or dependent variable and the MLE equations as defined in the following. yi = Œ≤0+ Œ≤1xi1+ Œ≤2xi2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤pxip + Œµ</p><p>Where, yi denoted as response or dependent variable, xi means explanatory or independent variables, Œ≤0 means y-intercept that means terms of constant, Œ≤p coefficients of the given slope for the given independent variables and Œµ denoted as error terms in the given model also known as residuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Symbolic Representation</head><p>The main objective for symbolic representation is to be used to understand the nature of the parameter. The symbolic representation is one the methods for solving the statistical related problems. In this research mainly focused three major parameters namely time, confidentiality, amount, and class label. The parameters 'time' assigned as 'Œ∏', sources of 'confidentiality' level assigned as '¬µ'. Similarly, other fields like 'amount' of transactions named as 'Œ¥' and the 'class' label assigned as 'Œ∑' respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Correlation Coefficient</head><p>The linear correlation coefficient which is used to the given data that measures the strength of the given data and the linear relationship between two variables namely x and y. The linear correlation coefficient indicates the sign and direction of the linear relationship between x and y. When r nothing but correlation coefficient and the range of near 1 to ‚àí1. The correlation coefficient equation returns near 1 which means linear relationship is strong and the correlation coefficient return near 0, the linear relationship is weak. The linear correlation coefficient equation is presented in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ùëü = ùëõ(‚àë ùë•ùë¶)‚àí(‚àë ùë•) (‚àë ùë¶) ‚àö[ùëõ ‚àë ùë• 2 ‚àí(‚àë ùë•) 2 ] [ùëõ ‚àë ùë¶ 2 ‚àí(‚àë ùë¶) 2 ]</formula><p>(2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Decision Tree</head><p>The decision tree approaches used to involve the probability-based decision making which is represented the outcomes in a tree-shaped diagram to chart out a course of action in a statistical probability analysis. In this approach used to solve complex problems or branches and each possible branch indicate the decision tree could be a possible outcome. In this research using four different decision tree approaches namely M5, random forest, random tree, and REP tree. M5 model decision tree approaches is used to learner for regression task which is used to predict values of numerical response variable Y. The M5 decision tree approaches having linear regression functions are used to find the leaf nodes. M5 decision tree approaches very useful for finding the forecasting in various research area which can predict continuous numerical attributes. Random forests are an ensemble learning method for finding classification, regression, and other related tasks of decision trees at training time. It is used to solve the classification tasks; the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees.</p><p>Random tree is easy to intellectualize but will naturally suffer from extreme variance, which makes them not good in terms of precision. One way to affect this restriction is to make several alternatives of a single decision tree by choosing every time a separate subset of the same training set in the context of randomization-based ensemble methods. Random Trees (RT) belong to a class of machine learning algorithms which is used to makes predictions by averaging over the predictions of several independent base models. REP decision tree is a method for finding to generate a tree from a given dataset. It is careful to be an extension of C45 decision tree approach by enhancing the pruning stage by using Reduced Error Pruning (REP).</p></div>
